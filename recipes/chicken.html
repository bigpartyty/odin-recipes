        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>I find chicken thighs to be more flavorful than chicken breasts, and this schnitzel is a 
            perfect example. Not only is it delicious, it is also cooked in the air fryer, making it 
            lower in calories, oil free, and grease free.</p>
            <p>Using spray oil limits the amount of calories while maintaining that nice and crispy flavor.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, trimmed of fat</li>
                <li>1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                <li>avocado oil cooking spray</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place chicken thighs, 1 at a time, between 2 sheets of parchment paper and flatten with a mallet.</li>
                <li>Combine bread crumbs, salt, and black pepper in a shallow bowl. Place flour in a separate shallow bowl and beaten egg in a third shallow bowl. Dip chicken thighs first in flour, then in beaten egg, and finally coat with bread crumb mixture.</li>
                <li>Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place breaded thighs in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not touching; work in batches if necessary. Mist with avocado oil and cook for 6 minutes. Flip each thigh, mist with oil, and cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
